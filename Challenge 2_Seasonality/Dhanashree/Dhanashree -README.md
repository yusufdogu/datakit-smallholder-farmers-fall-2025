###### DATAKIT event X Producer's Direct -- Challenge 2: Seasonality -- 



My contribution would probably fall under Challenge 2: Seasonality. However, there would be a lot of overlapping themes from Challenge 1 as well. My main focus was on question topics and their frequencies, and if there were any patterns in their frequencies across months or years. Comparisons were also done between the three countries Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. GB was omitted from my analysis because I felt the data was too small when compared to these countries, and decided to stick with these three. 



Main aim of this analysis was to just perform preliminary analysis and explore any trends. The visualised plots are also added as a separate folder. 



This overview of the topics could help guide further analysis through NLP methods, by closing in on questions that may be related to topics of significance.
